# bash-cli-practice-game
A game-like cli tool to practice basic command line usage with bash.

To start practicing the game, downloading the bash-practice.sh file

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjsarsa/bash-cli-practice-game/refs/heads/main/bash-practice.sh
```

and then start it with `bash`:

```sh
bash bash-practice.sh
```

## Requirements

The only requirements should be bash and GNU coreutils (Git Bash compatible on Windows). If you have them installed and something is missing from your environment that the game requires, please create an issue.
